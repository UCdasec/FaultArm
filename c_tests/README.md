# Testing Vulnerability Detection

In order to test the functionality and accuracy of the tool, researchers created example files in C. These files were used to generate example files in assembly, which are then used as input for the tool.

Examples vary in range of complexity in order to test the robust pattern detection.

## Example

Example C files were generated by researchers independently. After all examples were created and merged, the assembly files were then generated.

### Compiler

In order to generate assembly files the following compiler was used:

```terminal
cc (Ubuntu 11.3.0-1ubuntu1~22.04) 11.3.0
Copyright (C) 2021 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
This is free software; see the source for copying conditions.  There is NO
warranty; not even for MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.
```

Compilation was done using the following command:

```bash
cc -S filename.c -o assembly_filename.s
```
